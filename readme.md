# LP2 - Time Series Forecast
*This is a time series forecasting problem. In this project,  ML model is built to predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.*

## Project Description
The project is structured into three stages:

Firstly, the Initial Exploratory Data Analysis stage occurs after the business and data understanding phase. This involves checking the merged data for missing values, and replacing or removing them based on their nature. Relevant questions are then asked to understand the sales trends and business operation of Favorita.

  Secondly, the Time Series Analysis stage focuses on analyzing the sales trend over time. This includes identifying the seasons of high and low sales throughout the data, as well as assessing the impact of an earthquake using visualizations in Python.

 Lastly, the project moves to Feature Engineering, Model Development and Training, Model Evaluation and Selection, Model Deployment, and Model Monitoring and Maintenance stages.
